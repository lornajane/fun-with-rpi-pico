# Fun with the Raspberry Pi Pico

I have a Raspberry Pi Pico, I like it, this repository is where I keep my fun pico software. You are very welcome to use everything you find here, and contributions are welcome but this isn't my main occupation so response times may vary.

If you're looking for a post on getting started, I wrote a [high level overview of the RPi setup process on my blog](https://lornajane.net/posts/2021/intro-to-rpi-pico-with-mini-memory-game).

## Demos

Just one, so far: **mydemo.py** (naming things was difficult because I didn't know what I was building when I started. That's my excuse)

To run it, put the python file onto your pico and then use `import mydemo` in either a repl or your `main.py` file.

It's a game. Watch the pattern of lights at the start, and when the lights move, press pairs of buttons to swap them over and put the lights back into their pattern. When you win, press the flashing green button to start the next level.

If you edit the file (it's at the top) to add better colours or levels, I would love to know and play them myself!
